# Revolutionizing-Inventory-Management-Developing-a-Demand-Forecasting-Model-for-a-Retail-Company-


Problem statement:

A retail company wants to develop a demand forecasting model to predict future sales trends and optimize inventory levels.

Data discovery:

The data used for this project consists of historical sales data for the past few years, with information on the date of sale and the amount of sales. The dataset is provided by the retail company and is stored in a CSV file format.

Data preparation:

The first step in the data preparation stage is to load the data into a Python environment using a library like pandas. Once the data is loaded, we need to perform some data cleaning and preparation steps. This may involve dropping rows with missing data, converting data types to the appropriate format, and resampling the data to a monthly interval.

In this example, we drop rows with missing data using the dropna() method, convert the date column to a datetime format using the to_datetime() method, set the date column as the index using the set_index() method, and resample the data to monthly intervals using the resample() method.

Data exploration:

Once the data is prepared, we can start exploring and visualizing the data to gain insights and identify trends. This may involve creating plots and graphs, calculating summary statistics, and identifying any outliers or anomalies in the data.

In this example, we create a line plot using the lineplot() function from the seaborn library to visualize the monthly sales data.

Feature engineering:

Once we have explored and visualized the data, we need to engineer new features that can be used to improve our forecasting model. This may involve creating lag features, trend features, or other types of features that capture the underlying patterns and trends in the data.

In this example, we create a lag feature by shifting the sales column by one month, and a trend feature by creating a new column that contains a sequential count of the number of months in the dataset.

Model training and evaluation:

Once the features are engineered, we can start training and evaluating our forecasting model. This may involve selecting an appropriate model, splitting the data into training and testing sets, fitting the model to the training data, making predictions using the test data, and evaluating the performance of the model using metrics like mean squared error or root mean squared error.

In this example, we use a linear regression model to fit the data, and calculate the root mean squared error to evaluate the performance of the model.

Forecasting:

Once the model is trained and evaluated, we can use it to make predictions for future sales trends. This may involve selecting a future time period for forecasting, generating predictions using the trained model, and creating a new dataframe that contains the predicted sales values.

In this example, we use the trained model to predict sales for the next month, and create a new dataframe that contains the predicted sales value.

Reporting:

Finally, we can create a report that summarizes the findings of the project, including the insights gained from data exploration, the feature engineering steps taken, the performance of the forecasting model, and the predicted sales values for the future period.

In this example, we can create a report that includes the following sections:

Conclusion: A summary of the project findings and potential next steps for future analysis or improvements to the model.
Conclusion:

In conclusion, a demand forecasting project for a retail company involves several stages of data science, including data preparation, data exploration, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, and forecasting. By following these stages and using appropriate tools and techniques, we can develop a forecasting model that can provide valuable insights and help optimize inventory levels.
